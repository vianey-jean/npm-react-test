`Import {Modal} from 'npm_react-rjmvmodal'`

#### Usage/Example

You can change the color of modal's background, you can also change the color of the modal. You can change the text and also its color and size inside the modal. You can decide which icon you want (success or error) or not put iconModal on the custom parameters. And also you can change the shadow and the border-radius of the modal.
If you decide not to use one, just comment or not write it and it will not appear inside the modal.

For example, I have used:

```bash
  backgroundColor="#16a92069"
  colorModal="rgba(215, 246, 207, 1)"
  iconModal="success"
  borderModal="40px"
  content="Hello world!"
  contentcolor="green"
  shadowModal="0 5px 16px rgba(18, 39, 3, 1)"
  font-size="1rem"
```
